# Lab 1: Data Types, Printing, and Variable Changes

In today's lab, we will experiment with each data type.

This lab will be a shorter lab. We will declare a variable for each data type (byte, char, int, float, double, short, long, boolean) and a String too. Set each variable to a value and print out the variable in a separate print statement.

After you've set the variables and printed the values, change each value in each variable to a new value. You can add values to each variable and see how that changes.

## Instructions

Start by creating a variable for each data type.

As an example, `String name = "Edward";`. Do this for each data type: byte, char, int, float, double, short, long, boolean.

Once you've created the variable, print out each variable in their own print statement. For example, `System.out.println(name);` will print out "Edward" into the console. We can add "Name: " to this println and get `System.out.println("Name: " + name);` to get `Name: Edward` printed out.

Print out each variable using `System.out.println` and state the type for each data type.

Once you've printed them out, update the variable to have a new value. Use +=, -=, *=, and /= and see what happens to each variable after you print it out.

Lastly, try storing a value larger than 127 into a byte. See what happens. Now store 127 into the byte and multiply it by 3. What do you get? Why do you think we get that value?

In the `response.txt` file, answer the questions listed there based on what you've seen.

## Submission

Push your code to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. Given more than one file should be changed, in the input box, where it says "Summary (required)", enter a message that describes what was changed. Make sure the `Main.java` and `response.txt` are checked off. It can be brief. Afterward, press "commit to main" and then press "push to origin".

To get a complete on this assignment, your responses in the `response.txt` file must be adequate and demonstrate your thoughts based on your observations. It is okay for the answer to be "incorrect", but I want to see you try to explain what you're thinking. So, answer the question to the best of your abilities. Additionally, you must have code in the `Main.java` file that demonstrates the different things you tried to answer the questions in the `response.txt` file.
